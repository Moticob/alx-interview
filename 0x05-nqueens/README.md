## Project Description
The N queens problem entails placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To solve this problem, you'll need to understand and implement various key concepts such as backtracking algorithms, recursion, and list manipulations in Python.

### Concepts Required:
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Understanding how backtracking algorithms explore potential solutions and backtrack when necessary.
- **Recursion**: Implementing backtracking algorithms using recursive functions.
- **List Manipulations in Python**: Creating and manipulating lists, particularly for storing queen positions.
- **Python Command Line Arguments**: Handling command-line arguments using the sys module.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code should follow PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All files must be executable

### Tasks
#### 0. N queens (mandatory)
Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

- **Usage**: `nqueens N`
- If arguments are incorrect, print usage instructions and exit with status 1
- N must be an integer >= 4
- If N is not an integer, print an error message and exit with status 1
- If N is < 4, print an error message and exit with status 1
- The program should print every possible solution to the problem, one solution per line, in the specified format

**Example Output:**
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
